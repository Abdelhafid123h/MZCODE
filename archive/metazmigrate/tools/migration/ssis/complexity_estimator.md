# SSIS Migration Complexity Estimator Tool Design

## 🎯 Tool Overview
**SSISComplexityEstimator** - A tool for metazmigrate that estimates SSIS → Databricks migration complexity using Memgraph graph data.

## 🏗️ Tool Architecture

### **Core Components**

#### **1. ComplexityMetrics Data Class**
```python
@dataclass
class ComplexityMetrics:
    technical_score: float      # 1-10 scale
    business_score: float       # 1-10 scale  
    infrastructure_score: float # 1-10 scale
    team_score: float          # 1-10 scale
    overall_score: float       # 1-10 scale
    effort_hours: int          # Estimated hours
    team_size: int            # Recommended team size
    duration_weeks: int       # Estimated duration

    recommendations: List[str] # Migration recommendations
```

#### **3. Memgraph Integration**

**Complexity Queries**
```cypher
// Calculate technical complexity
MATCH (p:Package)-[:CONTAINS]->(t:Task)
WHERE p.project_id = $project_id
WITH p, count(t) as task_count,
     sum(t.complexity_score) as total_complexity
RETURN p.name, task_count, total_complexity,
       CASE 
         WHEN total_complexity < 10 THEN "Low"
         WHEN total_complexity < 25 THEN "Medium"
         WHEN total_complexity < 50 THEN "High"
         ELSE "Extreme"
       END as complexity_level

// Calculate project complexity
MATCH (p:Package)
WHERE p.project_id = $project_id
WITH count(p) as package_count,
     avg(p.complexity_score) as avg_complexity
RETURN package_count, avg_complexity,
       package_count * avg_complexity as project_complexity
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### **Basic Usage**
```python
# Initialize estimator
estimator = SSISComplexityEstimator(graph_client)

# Estimate project complexity
complexity = estimator.estimate_project_complexity("ssis_advworks")

# Access results
print(f"Overall Complexity: {complexity.overall_score}/10")
print(f"Effort: {complexity.effort_hours} hours")
print(f"Team Size: {complexity.team_size} developers")
print(f"Duration: {complexity.duration_weeks} weeks")
```

### **Detailed Analysis**
```python
# Get detailed breakdown
analysis = estimator.get_detailed_analysis("ssis_advworks")

# Access risk factors
for risk in complexity.risk_factors:
    print(f"Risk: {risk}")

# Access recommendations
for rec in complexity.recommendations:
    print(f"Recommendation: {rec}")
```

## 📈 Effort Estimation Matrix

| Overall Score | Effort Hours | Team Size | Duration Weeks | Budget Range |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| 1-3 (Low)     | 40-80        | 1-2       | 1-2            | $6K-$12K     |
| 4-6 (Medium)  | 80-240       | 2-3       | 2-6            | $12K-$36K    |
| 7-8 (High)    | 240-480      | 3-4       | 6-12           | $36K-$72K    |
| 9-10 (Extreme)| 480-960      | 4-6       | 12-24          | $72K-$144K   |

## 🔍 Risk Factors

### **High-Risk Indicators**
- **Custom SSIS components** (+2 complexity points)
- **Complex business rules** (+2 complexity points)
- **Real-time requirements** (+2 complexity points)
- **Regulatory compliance** (+2 complexity points)

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Incremental migration** for high-complexity projects
- **Parallel development** for complex components
- **Extensive testing** for critical paths
- **Rollback procedures** for high-risk items

## 🚀 Implementation in Memgraph

### **Complexity Schema**
```cypher
// Create complexity nodes
CREATE (:ComplexityAssessment {
  project_id: "ssis_advworks",
  technical_score: 7.2,
  business_score: 6.1,
  infrastructure_score: 5.0,
  team_score: 4.0,
  overall_score: 6.2,
  effort_hours: 320,
  team_size: 3,
  duration_weeks: 8
})

// Link to packages
MATCH (p:Package {project_id: "ssis_advworks"})
CREATE (c:ComplexityAssessment)-[:ASSESSS]->(p)
```

### **Query Examples**
```cypher
// Get complexity by package
MATCH (p:Package)-[:HAS_COMPLEXITY]->(c:ComplexityAssessment)
WHERE p.project_id = "ssis_advworks"
RETURN p.name, c.overall_score, c.effort_hours

// Get high-complexity packages
MATCH (p:Package)-[:HAS_COMPLEXITY]->(c:ComplexityAssessment)
WHERE c.overall_score > 7
RETURN p.name, c.overall_score, c.risk_factors
```
